            <p class="flavor">Foxes are renowned as clever animals, able to avoid the hunterâ€™s hounds which seek them for their valuable furs. They are most active at night, but they can also be seen by day. Their tails are always tipped white, while their legs, feet, and tips of the ear are always black. The rest of their coat, however, is varied in color: Most commonly red, silver and platinum foxes are also known.</p>

            <p>For yourself, you've been awakened by a heroic mage who blessed you with the gift of knowledge. Desite parting ways, you explore the land, spreading their name for all to hear.</p>
